      <description>Simulating gambling tactics This is a story about one time when I was and I stumbled upon a new domain of interest. This interest was related to gambling and it occured when a friend of mine told me of a ‚Äúfoolproof‚Äù betting strategy for the game of roulette.
The gambling strategy For any games where there is a near 50% chance of winning and where winning doubles your money and losing loses all your money you do this: First bet $1, if you lose this bet instead of betting $1, on the next turn you bet $2 (double the previous bet), if you lose again, bet $4, then $8 etc.</description>

      <description>TLDR: I made a device that logs all the wifi traffic and maps it out. It can also do some hacking stuff. Intro I knew I wanted to make something. I love making stuff. Making a physical thing would be awesome, something that was small and discrete, something that would make me feel like a spy hiding in plain sight. At the time of this spell of inspiration, I was learning about wifi and its capabilities at uni.</description>
