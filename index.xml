      <description>Simulating gambling tactics TLDR: Gambling bad. If you have a LOT of money, you can win a SMALL amount of money with a high probability (but then you aren‚Äôt allowed to play ever again). This is a story about one time when I was and I stumbled upon a new domain of interest. This interest was related to gambling and it occured when a friend of mine told me of a ‚Äúfoolproof‚Äù betting stratergy for the game of roulette.</description>

      <title>Vivisense: a new word</title>

      <description>Vivisense can be best described using the words ‚Äúprompt‚Äù and ‚Äústory‚Äù. When given a certain prompt, your brain creates a story around that.
E.g the prompt could be ‚Äúa vacation in Europe‚Äù and the vivisense is the story that your brain tells of the experience. Even though you might not know exactly what is going to happen, the gaps are filled in and a story is created about the vacation in Europe.</description>

      <description>TLDR: I made a device that logs all the wifi traffic and maps it out. It can also do some hacking stuff. Intro I knew I wanted to make something. I love making stuff. Making a physical thing would be awesome, something that was small and discrete, something that would make me feel like a spy hiding in plain sight. At the time of this spell of inspiration, I was learning about wifi and its capabilities at uni.</description>
