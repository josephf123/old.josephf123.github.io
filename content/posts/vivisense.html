    <p>Vivisense can be best described using the words “prompt” and “story”. </p><p>
    When given a certain prompt, your brain creates a story around that.</p>
    <p>E.g the prompt could be “a vacation in Europe” and the vivisense is the story that your brain tells of the experience. Even though you might not know exactly what is going to happen, the gaps are filled in and a story is created about the vacation in Europe. It might include picturing the warm breeze of Italy, eating an authentic pizza, walking around and looking at the nice religious architecture.</p>
    <p>The whole point of vivisense is that it is purely individual, no two people will share the same vivisense. It comes from your view of life and your past memories.</p>
    <p>The prompt can be a short sentence, it can be a book, movie, song, person, place, object etc.</p>
    <p>The addition of this word into our vocabulary is to better understand how humans work and how to sympathise better with others. Two individuals can create completely different stories from the same prompt, and because of these completely different vivisenses, their feelings towards it are also different.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>However, using the word story is not a full proper definition. Vivisense is a lot more than just a story. It is a mood, a feeling, an experience, a world that you create from a prompt. In this vivisense, it is engrossing, it becomes everything. It’s also a bit more meta than just a story, it is also a story about everything, its as if it is a lense to view the world.</p>
